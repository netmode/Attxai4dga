# Attention-Based DGA Detection with Explainable AI

Our approach enhances the classic **MLP classifier** by integrating **Multi-Head Attention (MHA)** and **SHAP-based explainability**. MHA helps capture complex dependencies in the input, improving classification performance, while **SHAP** provides insights into the modelâ€™s decisions.
